## Usage

A set of PowerShell examples is provided under the examples directory of this project. 

For help message, please use:

```
Import-Module .\example_module_name.psm1
Get-help example_module_name
```

### Using the PowerShell examples to get and set values


Simply run the PowerShell script to print out the values from the HTTP GET request.

This example prints the current system power state (such as On or Off)

```
Import-Module ./ lenovo_get_power_state.psm1
lenovo_get_power_state.psm1
```

This example prints the system current power state, passes one of the values (ForceOff) to force the server to shutdown ,and then print reset types that are supported by this server if exception occurred.

```
Import-Module ./ lenovo_set_power_state.psm1
lenovo_set_power_state â€“reset_type ForceOff
```
